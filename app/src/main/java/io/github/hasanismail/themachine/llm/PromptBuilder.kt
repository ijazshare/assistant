/**
 * Builds the prompt the model sees.
 *
 * Compactness is the whole design here, for two measured reasons. Prefill dominates
 * latency: a verbose tool listing ran to roughly 1600 tokens and cost 8–28 seconds on
 * device before a single output token appeared. And a 1B model asked to read a long
 * specification simply stops discriminating — the first version of this prompt made it
 * answer every request with the same tool.
 *
 * So: one line per tool, arguments named but not explained, and three worked examples.
 * The examples do more work than any amount of prose, because they show the exact
 * output shape rather than describing it. The grammar enforces the shape anyway, which
 * is precisely why the prompt does not need to.
 *
 * The current date and time are stated explicitly because the model has no clock, and
 * one left to guess will confidently invent a date.
