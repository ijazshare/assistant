/**
 * The assistant's voice: Piper's en_US-amy-medium, run offline through sherpa-onnx.
 *
 * Synthesis and playback are deliberately one call. A reply is a single short sentence
 * that has to finish before the overlay can go away, so there is nothing to gain from
 * handing the caller a buffer and a second thing to remember to do with it.
 *
 * Every use of the native synthesiser happens under [engineLock], and so does freeing
 * it. Without that, dismissing the overlay while a reply was still being synthesised
 * freed the engine under a thread that was reading from it — a SIGSEGV, found the first
 * time a test tore a session down promptly.
