/**

 * sampler may only choose tokens the grammar permits, so the output is valid JSON
 * naming a real tool with declared arguments *by construction* — not because the
 * model was asked nicely and usually complies. There is no parse-and-retry loop and
 * no "the model said something odd" branch, because those states are unreachable.
 *
 * Generated in Kotlin rather than through llama.cpp's JSON-schema converter so it
 * can be unit-tested without a device or a model.
